### 2. **Poor Semantic Understanding**
- Sentence transformers disabled
- Basic TF-IDF only
- No context awareness

### 3. **Inadequate Keyword Matching**
- Limited synonyms and variations
- No legal terminology database
- Poor handling of paraphrasing

### 4. **Scoring System Issues**
- High false positives
- Low precision
- Inadequate confidence scoring

## 🔧 Improvement Strategy

### Phase 1: Immediate Fixes (Week 1)

#### 1.1 Enhanced TF-IDF Configuration
```python

max_features=1000, ngram_range=(1, 2), similarity_threshold=0.3

# Improved
max_features=2000, ngram_range=(1, 3), similarity_threshold=0.15
```

#### 1.2 Legal Synonyms Database
```python
legal_synonyms = {
    "theft": ["steal", "stolen", "robbery", "pickpocket", "burglary", "larceny", "thief", "stole", "took", "snatched"],
    "assault": ["hit", "beat", "punch", "slap", "kick", "attack", "physical assault", "bodily harm", "battery", "strike"],
    "murder": ["kill", "murder", "homicide", "death", "dead", "killed", "killing", "assassination", "slay", "slain"],
    # ... more categories
}
```

#### 1.3 Pattern Matching
```python
crime_patterns = {
    "theft": [r"stole my", r"took my", r"stolen", r"missing", r"lost my"],
    "assault": [r"hit me", r"beat me", r"attacked me", r"assaulted me"],

## 📊 Expected Improvements

### Target Metrics (After Implementation)
- **F1-Score: 65-75%** (+150-200% improvement)
- **Precision: 60-70%** (+250-300% improvement)
- **Recall: 70-80%** (+30-50% improvement)
- **Overall Accuracy: 40-50%** (significant improvement)

### Confidence Levels
- **High Confidence (>80%):** 60-70% of predictions
- **Medium Confidence (50-80%):** 20-30% of predictions
- **Low Confidence (<50%):** 10-20% of predictions

## 🛠️ Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Create Enhanced ML Module
```bash
# Create improved accuracy module
touch enhanced_ml_enhancer.py
```

### Step 2: Expand IPC Database
```bash
# Add more IPC sections
# Enhance existing sections with better keywords
# Add legal synonyms and patterns
```

### Step 3: Implement Pattern Matching
```bash
# Add regex-based crime detection
# Implement context-aware scoring
# Add legal terminology matching
```

### Step 4: Test and Validate
```bash
# Run comprehensive accuracy tests
# Compare with baseline
# Fine-tune parameters
```

### Step 5: Deploy and Monitor
```bash
# Replace existing ML module
# Update UI claims
# Implement monitoring
```

## 🎯 Success Criteria

### Minimum Viable Improvements
- **F1-Score > 50%** (double current performance)
- **Precision > 40%** (significant reduction in false positives)
- **Recall > 60%** (better coverage of relevant sections)
- **Overall Accuracy > 20%** (some exact matches)

### Target Improvements
- **F1-Score > 70%** (competitive performance)
- **Precision > 60%** (high quality predictions)
- **Recall > 75%** (comprehensive coverage)
- **Overall Accuracy > 40%** (good exact matches)

## 🚀 Next Actions
