## 📊 **Test Results with Gemini AI**

### **Example 1: Theft Case**
**Query:** "Someone stole my phone"

**Gemini Summary:**
> "Someone stole your phone, which is theft under Indian Penal Code Section 379. This carries a potential penalty of up to three years imprisonment, a fine, or both. Report the theft to the police immediately to file a First Information Report (FIR) and increase the chances of recovering your phone."

**Analysis:**
- ✅ **Accurate legal identification** (IPC 379)
- ✅ **Clear penalty explanation** (3 years + fine)
- ✅ **Practical action steps** (file FIR)
- ✅ **User-friendly language**

### **Example 2: Assault Case**
**Query:** "A person hit me with a stick during an argument"

**Gemini Summary:**
> "Someone hitting you with a stick during an argument may fall under IPC 324 (causing hurt by a dangerous weapon), potentially resulting in up to 3 years imprisonment or a fine. If the attack was intended to cause death, IPC 307 (attempt to murder) with a much harsher penalty could apply. Seek immediate medical attention and report the incident to the police to initiate a legal process."

**Analysis:**
- ✅ **Multiple legal scenarios** (IPC 324 vs 307)
- ✅ **Severity assessment** (dangerous weapon)
- ✅ **Medical and legal guidance**
- ✅ **Progressive action steps**

### **Example 3: Cyber Crime Case**
**Query:** "Someone posted my private photos online without permission"

**Gemini Summary:**
> "Someone posting your private photos online without permission is a serious issue. While the provided IPC sections relate to theft and intimidation, they may not directly apply; the specific offense depends on the context (e.g., violation of privacy laws, defamation). Collect evidence and consider reporting this to law enforcement and seeking legal counsel to explore your options."

**Analysis:**
- ✅ **Honest assessment** of legal limitations
- ✅ **Context awareness** (privacy vs theft laws)
- ✅ **Evidence collection guidance**
- ✅ **Professional referral** (legal counsel)

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Gemini Integration Architecture:**
```python
def generate_gemini_summary(user_input, relevant_sections):
    """Generate AI-powered summary using Gemini"""
    # 1. Prepare context from relevant IPC sections
    # 2. Create intelligent prompt for legal analysis
    # 3. Generate contextual summary
    # 4. Return user-friendly explanation
```

### **Enhanced Response Flow:**
```
User Query → Enhanced ML Analysis → Gemini AI Summary → Combined Response
     ↓              ↓                    ↓                ↓
  Input Text   IPC Sections        AI Summary      Final Response
```

### **API Response Structure:**
```json
{
  "message": "Enhanced analysis with IPC sections...",
  "sections": [...],
  "confidence": 0.65,
  "gemini_summary": "AI-powered legal summary...",
  "system_version": "Enhanced v2.0",
